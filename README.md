# AI-Delinquency-Forecasting-System
## Overview
Delinquency Radar is a machine-learning model that detects early loan-delinquency risk using telecom micro-credit data. After data cleaning and feature engineering, a cost-sensitive XGBoost model handles imbalance. It supports MFS, banks, and micro finance by reducing defaults and improving financial inclusion

### Key Features:

Costumer spending habits
Period for loan repayment
Average recharge amount

### Top findings:

Users labeld 0 tend to pay back their loans on the same day
Individuals who take out small loan amounts tend to require longer repayment durations
Most customers fall within the medium-risk category
Most customers are delinquent

## Conclusion:
Our AI model effectively predicts loan repayment behavior using telecom usage patterns, offering accurate and reliable risk insights.
Feature analysis and smart recommendations support better, data-driven credit decisions.
Looking ahead, we aim to enhance the model using longer historical time-series data to enable accurate forecasting and to support a more intelligent and automated decision-making system.
